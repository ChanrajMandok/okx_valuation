## Executive Summary
This repository retrieves all ETHâ€“USD Options from OKX with a maturity of less than 20 days and creates ModelOptionMarket objects that hold all the required information such as the strike price, option type, spot price, ask price, ask size, bid size, bid price, maturity, base currency, and quote currency. The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model is then used to price these options. The BSM model is a mathematical model used to price options by considering various factors such as the stock price, strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and interest rates. This model was developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973 and is widely used in the finance industry to value options. However, it has some limitations, such as assuming that the underlying asset price follows a lognormal distribution, which might not hold true in reality.

The options are then divided into different maturities, and for each maturity, the implied volatility is plotted using the volatility surface area. The volatility surface area gives a visual representation of the implied volatility across different strikes and maturities, which is an important measure for options traders. It helps traders to understand the market's perception of future volatility, which can be used to price options and manage risk.
Additionally, the volatility smile is plotted for each maturity. The volatility smile shows the relationship between implied volatility and strike price for a single maturity. It is a term used in quantitative finance to describe the implied volatility curve of options of the same underlying asset and expiration date. The term "smile" arises from the shape of the curve, which resembles a smile. The volatility smile was first observed after the 1987 stock market crash and has become a foundation in the field of quantitative finance. The smile demonstrates that the implied volatility is not constant but varies with the strike price of the option.
