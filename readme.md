## Executive Summary
This repository retrieves all ETHâ€“USD Options from OKX with a maturity of less than TIME_TO_MATURITY_MAX_DAYS days and creates ModelOptionMarket objects that hold all the required information such as the strike price, option type, spot price, ask price, ask size, bid size, bid price, maturity, base currency, and quote currency. The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model is then used to price these options. The BSM model is a mathematical model used to price options by considering factors such as the spot price, strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and interest rates. This model was developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973 and is widely used in the finance industry to value options. However, it has some limitations, such as assuming that the underlying asset price follows a lognormal distribution, which does not hold in periods of Financial turmoil.

The options are then divided into different maturities, and for each maturity, the implied volatility is plotted to produce the volatility surface area. The volatility surface area gives a visual representation of the implied volatility across different strikes and maturities. The volatility surface area helps traders to understand the market's perception of future volatility and identify potiential asymmetries in option pricing. Additionally, the volatility smile is plotted for each maturity. The volatility smile shows the relationship between implied volatility and strike price for a single maturity. The term "smile" arises from the shape of the curve, which resembles a smile. The volatility smile was first observed after the 1987 stock market crash and has become a foundation in the field of quantitative finance. The smile demonstrates that the implied volatility is not constant but varies with the strike price of the option.

Finally, if the code is provided with Binance keys, it will calculate the historical volatility measures from the historical volatility files, this includes empirically verified methods such as Rodgers-Sachall, Yhang Zhang, Subsampled volatility, Volatility of Volatility, Garch(1,1) volatility Forecast and finally a Kalman Filter applied upon the volatility dataset. These meusres can provide additional infomation when pricing Options.
